# Rictche-Pickles-Auction-Scraper

Scrape Mack auction listings from Pickles and Ritchie Bros. Then save the results to excel 

This script is to save me time looking at auction lisitngs for a truck i want to purchase

This script runs from task scheduler once a week, so I can check one excel file and see if there are any items that interest me

More auction sites to be added soon

Pages to be scraped are found by direct links these would need to be modifed to change make or locations

File save location would need to be changed for other users
